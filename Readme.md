## Readme file Formatting 

To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the hierarchy level and typeface size of the heading.

You can quote text with a >.

To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks. (``` ```)

You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). 
This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

You can display an image by adding ! and wrapping the alt text in [ ]. Alt text is a short text equivalent of the information in the image. Then, wrap the link for the image in parentheses ().
